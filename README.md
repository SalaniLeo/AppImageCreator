  <h4>it's my first app so it wont be good and i tested the app only on pop os 22.04(should work also with 21.04 and 21.10)<h4>
  
  <h2>How To Use</h2>
  
   <p>Requires glibc 2.35 or higher <br> 
    Select the executable file you want to package <br> 
    Set the name <br> Select the image (must be max 256x256) <br> 
    Set the application type (check <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html" target="_blank"> valid types</a>)<br> 
     Set the application category (check <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/menu-spec-1.0.html#category-registry" target="_blank">  valid categories</a>) <br> 
    
  <h2>Folder mode</h2> <br>
  <p> This mode is still in beta <br> 
    folder mode won't work for apps that require external dependencies 
    <br> <br> 
    To use this mode you have to select the executable file inside the application directory(for example /app/bin/exec and not /app/exec), then select the     folder that contains the app(based on the example above /app/)
  
  <b>This mode is still being developed so if you have any ideas tell me!<b>
